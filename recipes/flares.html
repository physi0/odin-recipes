        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>A gymnastics and breakdancing/bboying foundational powermove that looks <em>hella</em> cool but is insanely hard to learn and perfect. Be prepared to sacrifice many hours of your life for years to get this skill.</p>
        <h4>Muscles Involved</h4>
        <p>Pretty much <em>everything</em>. Primarily hips (glutes/hip abductors & flexors), triceps, deltoids, pectorals, latissimus dorsi, trapezius (lower), serratus anterior, forearm stabilisers (primarily wrist flexors), core/abdominals, and spinal extensors.</p>
        <h4>Recommended Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Good straddle split flexiblity</li>
            <li>L-sit</li>
            <li>Tuck planche</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <em>The below instructions are going clockwise. If you are going counter-clockwise then use the opposite arm/leg/direction.</em>
        <ol>
            <li>The starting position is the suplex where your hands are on the floor balancing the weight of your body. Your feet should hang just wide of your arms. Your hands should be pointing out at 45-degree angle.</li>
            <li>Kick your left leg around, towards your face. Simultaneously lift your left hand and swing it up over your body and under. As your left leg swings up and in front of you, naturally let your right leg follow in the same motion.</li>
            <li>As your right leg completes the rotation in front of you, your left hand should make contact with the floor behind you, and you shift your weight to your left hand. Continue the momentum of your legs, swinging them under your body and returning to the starting position. Keeping the momentum going and continuing the circular movement with your legs will let you keep doing multiple flares.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p><em>How long will it take me to get it?</em></p>
        It varies hugely depending on many factors including your general build, baseline abilities, training regime, etc. However, flares will most likely take years to master and get clean.
        <p><em>Any tips?</em></p>
        Having good straddle split flexibility and hip strength will massively help. Be able to do the prerequisite moves above easily. Keep your shoulders locked and depressed. Keep your hand placements close to your body. Keep your hips open and engaged to generate circular momentum force.  
        <p><em>I can do it, now what?</em></p>
        More rounds, cleaner, higher, faster. Variations e.g. chair flare. Transitions to other powermoves e.g. windmills.
