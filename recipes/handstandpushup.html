        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p><em>How long will it take me to get it?</em></p>
        It varies hugely depending on many factors including your general build, baseline abilities, training regime, etc. If you are currently unable to hold a freestanding handstand then it will likely take 12-24+ months of consistent training to achieve a clean repetition. 
        <p><em>Any tips?</em></p>
        Focus on getting a solid handstand hold. You will naturally improve your bent arm strength by continuously saving your handstand falls. Slow eccentrics and time held under tension will help a lot. Place your hands slightly wider than your normal handstand position to increase your base of support. Try to keep your forearms vertical to the ground. When lowering your head position should come forward infront of your hands. Record yourself regularly to check your form and correct as required. Be patient and consistent, you will get it. 
        <p><em>I can do it, now what?</em></p>
        Progressions. Increase range of motion by doing it on a step/ledge/blocks. Build up repetitions. Increase resistance by using a weighed vest. Plyometrics - jumping handstand push ups, clapping handstand push ups. Achieve god level one arm handstand push ups (good luck).
