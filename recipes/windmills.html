        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>A breakdancing/bboying foundational powermove that looks cool but you will endure much pain and sufffering in the process of getting it. Blood may be shed and tears may be cried.</p>
        <h4>Muscles Involved</h4>
        <p>Hips (glutes/hip abductors & flexors), neck, triceps, deltoids, pectorals, forearm stabilisers (primarily wrist flexors), core/abdominals, and spinal extensors.</p>
        <h4>Recommended Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cricket freeze</li>
            <li>Baby freeze</li>
            <li>Chair freeze</li>
            <li>Useful transitions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cricket to baby to chair freeze</li>
                <li>Headswipe (getting from on your back to cricket/baby freeze)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Good straddle split flexiblity</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <em>The below instructions are going clockwise. If you are going counter-clockwise then use the opposite arm/leg/direction.</em>
        <ol>
            <li>The starting position is the crab or cricket freeze. Your hands will be in contact with the floor. Your right hand should be directly under your hip with fingers pointing out right, keep a bend at your right elbow while it is tucked into your stomach; most of your bodyweight will be supported by this hand. Your left hand will near your left shoulder, helping you balance. Your legs (in the V-shape) and head will be in the air, and your body will be almost parallel to the floor.</li>
            <li>From the crab freeze position, swing your legs clockwise, driving with a kick from your right foot and bringing both legs around towards your head.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously with Step 2, drop your body onto your right shoulder to make way for legs to come around. You would basically be upside down at this point, transitioning to shift your bodyweight from your hands to your shoulders. Tuck your shoulder in at this point so it doesn’t get injured.</li>
            <li>Bring your legs around full circle, up in the air at this point. Both your shoulders should be making contact with the floor. Make sure to not drop onto your back – rest your bodyweight only on your shoulders at this point.</li>
            <li>From resting on your shoulders, shift your bodyweight forwards again and bring your hands down to return to the original crab freeze position, thereby completing the windmill. From here, you can kick again and perform multiple windmills</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p><em>How long will it take me to get it?</em></p>
        It varies hugely depending on many factors including your general build, baseline abilities, training regime, etc. Some people can get it within months and for some it may take years. 
        <p><em>Any tips?</em></p>
        Having good straddle split flexibility and hip strength will massively help. Be able to do the prerequisite moves above easily. Practice on mats when starting out. Try to keep your head on the floor. Your non-driving leg is also important to help you gain height especially when trying to connect multiple rounds.
        <p><em>I can do it, now what?</em></p>
        Make them faster & cleaner. Progressions and variations. Head mills, Barrel mills (no-handed), Baby/Munch mills, Tombstone mills, etc. Transitions to other powermoves e.g. flares.
